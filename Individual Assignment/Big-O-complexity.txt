1. Insert a new item at the beginning of the array
O(n)
requires a for loop since to insert an element in arr[0], all n elements need to be shifted to the right. n = number of elements in the array

2. Insert a new item at the end of the array
O(1)
we can directly place the element at the back of the array

3. Delete an item at the beginning of the array
O(n)
Also requires a loop. After deleting an item at the start of the array, the rest of the elements needs to get shifted over to fill in the empty space

4. Delete an item at the end of the array
O(1)
we can directly delete the element since it's at the last index where no shifting is required (the array size can just be reduced by 1).
